# GeneSelection
Gene selection using tree based ensemble techniques.


Discussion
In this project, around 22 gene expression microarray data of various diseases were analysed using 6 different machine learning algorithms. Each dataset comprising varied feature numbers and observations gives us the idea of how these machine learning algorithms work with a broad spectrum of dimensions. The algorithms are designed in such a way to ensure the stability of the model by splitting the original data set into training and testing data sets. These algorithms after calculating the accuracy of the predictions based on the model, they identify the significant genes (feature importance) responsible which shows variations from the normal genes. These genes are the biomarkers which we are looking for further validation. 


Conclusion
In this project, apart from generally used machine learning algorithms (decision tree and random forest) some advanced algorithms like Gradient boosting and Extreme gradient boosting are used. When it comes to advanced research like gene expression microarray data, these technologies provide a robust model to find the abnormal gene with high efficiency in spite of the huge size of input dataset. These types of reliable computational models will help in reducing the time and cost for designing advanced diagnostic and therapy of various diseases. More advanced studies like proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics can also be done using the above discussed machine learning algorithms. The whole progression of a disease from onset to critical stage can be tracked using these ‘omics’ studies.
